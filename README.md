# 💫 Project Summary: Building a Serverless API with Full Observability
<br>**What I'm Doing**  <br>I'm developing a serverless REST API using AWS Lambda, API Gateway, and DynamoDB, with a focus on observability. The API has two endpoints:  <br>- `/ping` → Returns a success response.  <br>- `/fail` → Simulates errors for testing.  <br><br>To ensure full visibility into performance and issues, I'm implementing a three-pillar observability stack:  <br>1. **Metrics** (CloudWatch) – Tracking latency, request counts, and errors.  <br>2. **Logs** (CloudWatch → Grafana Loki) – Structured JSON logs for debugging.  <br>3. **Traces** (AWS X-Ray → Grafana Tempo) – Distributed tracing for request flows.  <br><br>All of this data is being consolidated into a single Grafana dashboard, giving me a unified view of the API’s health. The infrastructure is deployed using Terraform (IaC) and automated via Jenkins CI/CD.  <br><br>**Why I'm Doing It**  <br>1. **To Learn Observability Best Practices** – Understanding how metrics, logs, and traces work together in a real-world serverless environment.  <br>2. **To Improve Debugging & Monitoring** – Ensuring I can quickly detect and diagnose issues (like high latency or errors) using correlated data.  <br>3. **To Optimize Costs** – Leveraging AWS Free Tier and Grafana Cloud’s free plan to keep costs near zero while still getting powerful insights.  <br>4. **To Demonstrate End-to-End DevOps** – Showing how IaC (Terraform), CI/CD (Jenkins), and observability (Grafana) integrate in a production-like setup.  <br><br>**Key Challenges & Solutions**  <br>- **Correlating Data** → Using X-Ray Trace IDs to link logs, metrics, and traces.  <br>- **Cost Control** → Setting short log retention (1 day) and using free-tier services.  <br>- **Automation** → Terraform ensures repeatable deployments; Jenkins handles CI/CD.  <br><br>**Outcome**  <br>By the end, I’ll have a fully observable, scalable, and cost-efficient serverless API, with a Grafana dashboard that provides:  <br>✅ Real-time metrics & alerts  <br>✅ Structured logs for debugging  <br>✅ End-to-end request tracing  <br>✅ A single pane of glass for monitoring  <br><br>This project mimics a real-world scenario, preparing me to implement observability for production systems.
